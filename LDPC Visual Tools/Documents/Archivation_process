This is how a matrix is archived, and the generated file will look (a single line string):
1. Take the matrix sizes and write row_number/column_number/
2. Add the values: row_0row_1...row_n 
3. If a value is repeated without interruption for more than 3 times do this:
    - if value is 0, instead of writing N 0's, write .N.
    - if value is 1, instead of writing M 1's, write /M/
4. Repeat until the end of file. 
Example:
1 0 1 0 1 0 1           
0 1 0 1 0 1 1   --->  3\6\10101010101011111.4.
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
